    <h2>1. Pre-Islamic Turkish History</h2>
    <p class="tagline">
      Early Turkic societies from Inner Asia to Eastern Europe: political organisation, divine kingship, töre (customary law), social structure, economy, writing, inscriptions and epic tradition.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Geographic Environment and Main Turkic Groups</h3>
    <p>
      Pre-Islamic Turkish history unfolds mainly across the Eurasian steppe belt stretching from Manchuria and
      Mongolia in the east to the Black Sea and Eastern Europe in the west. This vast sea of grass, with harsh
      winters and wide open plains, favoured a mobile way of life built on horse breeding and seasonal migration.
      Among the major Turkic and related nomadic groups we encounter in this period are the Scythians,
      Asian Huns, European Huns, Göktürks, Uighurs and various minor confederations that rose and fell in rapid
      succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steppe environment shaped not only the economy but also political and military culture. States rose
      quickly under charismatic leaders who could unite disparate clans and tribes, but they could also fragment
      rapidly when leadership weakened or when inheritance disputes broke out. This pattern is visible in the
      histories of most early Turkic polities.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Political Structure and the Ruler</h3>
    <p>
      In almost all early Turkic states the ruler stood at the centre of the political system. Known by titles
      such as Han, Hakan or Kağan, he combined roles that in sedentary societies were often separated: he was
      supreme commander, chief legislator, high judge and symbol of divine favour. His authority was not
      unlimited: he was expected to consult the Kurultay – a council of nobles, clan leaders and high officers – 
      on vital matters such as war, peace and succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the ruler’s most important duties was to maintain the balance between central authority and the
      autonomy of powerful tribal leaders. If he favoured one group excessively, he risked rebellion from
      others; if he appeared weak, allies and enemies alike would desert him. Therefore early Turkic political
      leadership required military prowess, diplomatic skill and the ability to distribute resources and honours
      fairly.
    </p>

    <h4>Symbols and Titles of Sovereignty</h4>
    <p>
      Sovereignty was represented by a set of visible symbols: the royal tent (<em>otağ</em>) in which the ruler held
      audiences; war drums (<em>nevbet</em>) beaten to announce his presence; the <em>tuğ</em> – a standard decorated with
      horse tails; the throne (<em>taht</em>); feather ornaments attached to the ruler’s headgear or standard; and
      ceremonial weapons such as the bow, dagger and sword. These items were displayed at important gatherings
      and in battle, reminding everyone of the sacred dimension of rulership.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Divine Origin of Power: Kut, Küç and Ülüg</h3>
    <p>
      Early Turks believed that legitimate political power originated from the Sky God, <strong>Gök Tanrı</strong>. The
      concept of <strong>kut</strong> expressed this idea: it was a kind of divine grace or sacred charisma granted to
      the ruling family. A person lacking kut could not legitimately rule; conversely, a ruler who abused his
      power or failed to protect the people could be interpreted as having lost his kut, making rebellion
      morally justifiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside kut, two other notions are often mentioned: <strong>küç / güç</strong>, meaning the strength and military
      capacity necessary to enforce decisions, and <strong>ülüg / ülüş</strong>, the right to share and distribute spoils
      and resources. These three elements together created a religious, military and economic basis for
      sovereignty. Because kut was considered to belong to the dynasty as a whole, the state itself was seen as
      the joint possession of all male members, which produced chronic succession disputes after the death of
      powerful rulers.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Customary Law: Töre</h3>
    <p>
      The legal system of early Turks was built on <strong>töre</strong>, a body of customs, precedents and moral norms
      recognised by the community. Töre was not initially written; it lived in collective memory, was invoked by
      elders and judges, and could be adjusted by the ruler with the approval of the Kurultay. It regulated
      everything from blood feuds, theft and compensation to marriage rules, inheritance and alliances among
      tribes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, particularly among the Uighurs, parts of töre began to be written down. This process did not
      replace oral tradition but provided stability and clarity in complex cases. Four constant principles are
      emphasised in descriptions of töre: <strong>justice</strong> (decisions must be fair), <strong>usefulness</strong> (they must
      benefit the community), <strong>equality</strong> (similar cases require similar treatment) and <strong>humanity</strong>
      (punishments must be proportional, not arbitrary cruelty).
    </p>
    <p>
      Courts were presided over by a <strong>Yarguci</strong> (judge), typically an experienced elder familiar with
      traditions. Punishments varied from fines and compensation to exile and execution. Long-term imprisonment
      was rare, since in a mobile society holding large numbers of people in jails was neither practical nor
      economical.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Social Life, Family and Gender</h3>
    <p>
      Social structure was layered but relatively flexible. The family constituted the smallest unit, grouped
      into clans and then into tribes and tribal confederations. Women in early Turkic societies generally had
      a more visible role compared to many contemporaneous sedentary societies. Sources mention <em>hatun</em>,
      the queen or principal wife, participating in certain ceremonies and sometimes appearing alongside the
      ruler in inscriptions and diplomatic relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marriage was regulated by custom; monogamy was widespread, though polygamy existed among elites. The
      extended family cooperated in herding, moving camps, raising children and defending the community.
      Hospitality was a central value: travellers were welcomed and fed, while refusal to provide hospitality
      could be condemned as shameful.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Economic Life: Nomadism, Trade and Early Money</h3>
    <p>
      The steppe economy focused on herds, especially horses, sheep and cattle. Seasonal migration between
      summer pastures (<em>yaylak</em>) and winter quarters (<em>kışlak</em>) allowed efficient use of grasslands. Meat,
      dairy products, wool and leather formed the basis of diet and clothing. However, steppe peoples were not
      cut off from the settled world: they engaged in trade with Chinese, Iranian and later Islamic markets,
      exchanging animals, hides and sometimes slaves for textiles, grain, metal products and luxury goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      As trade intensified, different forms of money appeared. Metal coins (<em>yarmak</em>) circulated in some
      regions, while cloth money like <em>kamdu</em>, <em>böz</em> and <em>kuanpoyu</em> served as media of exchange. The Uighurs
      introduced paper money (<em>çav</em>) in certain cities, reflecting their more urbanised lifestyle and advanced
      commercial practices, especially after they adopted Buddhism and Manichaeism and established a literate
      bureaucratic culture.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Writing Systems and Inscriptions</h3>
    <p>
      The earliest Turkic inscriptions are found in the Yenisey basin, associated with the Kyrgyz, but the most
      famous ones are the <strong>Orhun Inscriptions</strong> in Mongolia. These monuments, erected for Bilge Kağan,
      Kül Tigin and Tonyukuk in the 8th century, are carved in a runic-style alphabet sometimes called the
      Orhun or Göktürk script. The texts praise heroic deeds, criticise internal disunity, and warn against
      being deceived by foreign powers, especially the Chinese.
    </p>
    <p>
      These inscriptions were rediscovered in the 19th century and deciphered primarily by Vilhelm Thomsen,
      opening a new era in Turkic philology. Later periods saw the use of Uighur script in bureaucratic and
      religious texts, as well as Chinese, Sogdian and eventually Arabic and Persian scripts after the adoption
      of Islam.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Oral Literature and Epic Heritage</h3>
    <p>
      The oral tradition of the Turks preserved a rich heritage of stories, songs and proverbs. <strong>Sav</strong>
      expressed concise wisdom; <strong>sagu</strong> lamented the death of leaders; <strong>koşuk</strong> celebrated love, war
      and nature. Large epic cycles recounted the origins of tribes, migrations, wars and heroic ancestors:
      Oğuz Kağan, Alp Er Tunga, Ergenekon, Türeyiş, Göç and the monumental Manas epic belong to this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      These epics are valuable not only as literature but also as sources for values and mentalities. They
      emphasise courage, loyalty to clan and ruler, cleverness in warfare, respect for oaths and deep attachment
      to the homeland. Later written literature in both pre-Islamic and Islamic periods drew heavily on this
      epic and proverbial inheritance.

    <h2>2. Turkish-Islamic States</h2>
    <p class="tagline">
      From the first Muslim Turkic dynasties to the Great Seljuks and Anatolian Seljuks: Islamization, administrative councils, land system, army, guilds, and intellectual life.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Islamization of the Turks</h3>
    <p>
      The adoption of Islam by Turkic groups was not a single event but a long historical process. Beginning in
      the 8th–9th centuries, Turks living along the frontier between the Islamic world and the steppe gradually
      encountered Muslim traders, missionaries and soldiers. Some groups entered the Abbasid military as
      mercenaries, where they learned Arabic, Islamic law and administrative practices. Others converted through
      contact with Sufi sheikhs who addressed nomadic beliefs in a flexible manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the 10th century, major Turkic dynasties such as the <strong>Karakhanids</strong> officially adopted Islam.
      This brought them into closer cultural interaction with Persian and Arab societies. It also gave them a
      new religious identity that transcended tribal divisions and allowed them to present themselves as
      protectors of the Muslim community.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Major Turkish-Islamic Dynasties</h3>
    <h4>Karakhanids</h4>
    <p>
      The Karakhanids ruled in Transoxiana and parts of Central Asia. They are significant as one of the first
      Muslim Turkic dynasties. Under their rule, cities such as Bukhara, Samarkand and Kashgar flourished as
      centres of learning and trade. The famous work <em>Kutadgu Bilig</em> (Wisdom of Royal Glory) reflects a synthesis
      of Turkic political ideals with Islamic ethics, discussing just rule, consultation, and the moral duties of
      the ruler toward his subjects.
    </p>

    <h4>Ghaznavids</h4>
    <p>
      The Ghaznavids, based in present-day Afghanistan, expanded their domains into Iran and the Indian
      subcontinent. Mahmud of Ghazni conducted numerous campaigns into northern India, spreading both political
      control and Islamic influence. The court of Ghazni attracted scholars and poets such as Ferdowsi, creator
      of the Persian epic <em>Shahnameh</em>. Although the dynasty was eventually weakened by internal strife and
      Seljuk pressure, it played an important role in linking Central Asia, Iran and India.
    </p>

    <h4>Great Seljuks</h4>
    <p>
      The <strong>Great Seljuk Empire</strong> emerged in the 11th century as a powerful Turkic-Muslim state stretching
      from Central Asia to Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean. They defeated the Ghaznavids at Dandanakan,
      entered Iran and Iraq, and took Baghdad, where they assumed the role of protectors of the Abbasid caliph.
      The Seljuks defended the Islamic world against the Byzantine Empire and later Crusaders, while also
      patronising scholars such as Nizam al-Mulk, who wrote the famous political treatise <em>Siyasatnama</em>.
    </p>

    <h4>Anatolian Seljuks</h4>
    <p>
      After the battle of Manzikert (1071), Seljuk and other Turkic groups advanced into Anatolia. The
      <strong>Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate</strong>, centred on Konya, developed a distinct political and cultural
      identity. It built caravanserais, madrasas and mosques, turning Anatolia into a significant Islamic
      land. Trade routes between the Black Sea, Mediterranean and Iran passed through its territory, generating
      wealth and stimulating urban growth in cities such as Kayseri, Sivas and Konya.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Administrative Divans and State Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Turkish-Islamic states integrated older Turkic institutions with Islamic and Iranian models. At the top
      stood the sultan, advised and supported by the <strong>divans</strong>. The <strong>Divan-ı Saltanat</strong> (or Divan-ı
      Ali) functioned as the supreme council: it discussed war, peace, taxation, appointments and foreign
      relations. High officials, including the vizier, military commanders and chief judges, attended its
      meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Divan-ı Arz</strong> supervised military affairs; the <strong>Divan-ı İstifa</strong> dealt with finance; the
      <strong>Divan-ı İşraf</strong> inspected provincial administration and prevented abuses; and the
      <strong>Divan-ı Tuğra</strong> drafted and sealed official documents. Additional specialised councils such as
      those regulating postal services, provincial land distribution and security show the growing
      differentiation of state functions.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Land System and Ikta</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>ikta system</strong> was a mechanism for linking land, taxation and military service. Instead of
      paying officials and soldiers directly from the central treasury, the state granted them the right to
      collect taxes from designated areas. In return, they maintained a certain number of cavalrymen and ensured
      local order. This arrangement reduced cash expenditures, encouraged local security, and integrated
      landowners into the military structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if not carefully monitored, ikta could lead to the emergence of semi-independent local powers.
      Therefore, the inspection divan and the central chancery played crucial roles in keeping records and
      correcting abuses. Over time, the ikta model influenced later systems such as the Ottoman tımar.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Army and Military Culture</h3>
    <p>
      Military forces combined several elements: palace-based <strong>gulam</strong> (mamluk-style) troops, provincial
      cavalry maintained through ikta, contingents provided by princes and atabeys, and sometimes tribal auxiliaries.
      The emphasis on cavalry and mobility reflected both steppe traditions and the geographic realities of
      Central Asia and Iran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Campaigns required complex logistics. Divan-ı Arz supervised supply lines, salaries and equipment.
      Fortresses were constructed or adapted along strategic routes; cities such as Rey, Isfahan and Konya
      served as administrative and military hubs. The Seljuks also invested in roads and caravanserais, which
      facilitated both trade and rapid troop movements.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Urban Life, Ahilik and Economy</h3>
    <p>
      In Anatolia, especially under the Anatolian Seljuks, towns grew into vibrant commercial and cultural
      centres. Guilds of artisans and merchants organised economic life. The most famous of these organisations
      was <strong>Ahilik</strong>, the Ahi Brotherhood. It combined professional training with ethical and spiritual
      education inspired by Islamic principles and Sufi teachings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an Ahi lodge, a young apprentice learned not only his craft – such as leatherworking, metalworking or
      textiles – but also honesty in trade, generosity, humility and fairness. Prices and quality standards were
      supervised, preventing fraud and protecting both consumers and fellow craftsmen. The Ahi system thus
      functioned as a social safety net and moral compass in Anatolian cities.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Intellectual and Cultural Flourishing</h3>
    <p>
      Turkish-Islamic states contributed to the broader Islamic civilisation in many ways. They supported
      madrasas where scholars studied Qur’anic exegesis, hadith, law, theology, philosophy and sometimes
      mathematics and medicine. The Nizamiyya madrasas, founded by Nizam al-Mulk in Seljuk domains, became
      prototypes for later Islamic educational institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poetry and Sufism flourished. Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi’s <em>Masnavi</em> explored mystical love and the
      journey of the soul. Yunus Emre expressed deep spiritual ideas in simple Turkish, shaping Anatolian
      religious culture. Hacı Bektaş-ı Veli’s teachings, collected in the <em>Makalat</em>, influenced both Sufi
      and popular beliefs. Architects, calligraphers and artisans left behind mosques, madrasas, bridges and
      caravanserais that still define the landscape of modern Turkey and Iran.

  <div id="t3" class="topic">
    <h2>3. Ottoman Culture &amp; Civilization</h2>
    <p class="tagline">
      The social and institutional world of the Ottoman Empire: central and provincial administration, land and tax systems, religious structure, economy, architecture and arts.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Central Administration and the Sultan</h3>
    <p>
      The Ottoman Empire inherited and transformed many institutions from earlier Islamic and Turkic states.
      At the top stood the sultan, whose authority combined military command, legislative initiative and the
      role of supreme judge. However, daily governance was largely carried out by a professional bureaucracy
      and the imperial council. The sultan’s power was symbolised by the palace, the throne, the sword of
      Osman used in enthronement ceremonies and a set of titles stressing his role as both ruler and protector
      of the Muslim community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Divan-ı Hümayun</strong>, or imperial council, met regularly to discuss state affairs. Members included
      the grand vizier, chief military judges of Anatolia and Rumelia (<em>kazaskers</em>), treasurers, the nişancı
      (head of the chancery) and, in later periods, representatives of the navy and other offices. Initially the
      sultan sat in person; later he watched and listened from behind a screen, symbolising a more distant but
      still decisive authority.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Provincial Administration and the Millet System</h3>
    <p>
      The empire’s territory was divided into provinces (<em>eyalet</em>), districts (<em>sancak</em>), subdistricts
      (<em>kaza</em>) and villages. Governors and local officials were responsible for implementing imperial
      orders, collecting taxes and maintaining security. The <strong>kadı</strong>, or judge, played a central role in each
      kaza, not only as a judicial authority but as a recorder of contracts, registers and local decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>millet system</strong> was a distinctive aspect of Ottoman civilisation. Religious communities such as
      Greek Orthodox Christians, Armenians and Jews were organised into semi-autonomous millets under their own
      spiritual leaders. These communities administered personal status law (marriage, divorce, inheritance) for
      their members and maintained schools and charitable institutions. This arrangement allowed a high degree
      of religious pluralism, even though Muslims enjoyed certain legal and fiscal privileges.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Land, Taxation and the Tımar System</h3>
    <p>
      The majority of land in the empire was classified as <strong>miri</strong> – technically owned by the state but
      granted to individuals for use and revenue collection. It was subdivided into <strong>has</strong>, <strong>zeamet</strong> and
      <strong>tımar</strong> according to annual income. Holders of these grants were expected to equip armoured cavalry
      and to appear in the field when called. In this way, the <strong>tımar system</strong> supported a substantial
      provincial army without requiring high cash expenditures from the central treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peasants who cultivated the land were not serfs in the European sense; they were free subjects, but they
      owed taxes and various dues. Registers called <em>tahrir defterleri</em> recorded villages, households, crops and
      tax obligations. In addition to tımar land, there were private lands (<strong>mülk</strong>) and especially
      <strong>vakıf</strong> lands, whose revenues financed mosques, schools, fountains, hospitals and other institutions.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Economic Mentality and Guilds</h3>
    <p>
      The Ottoman economic mentality aimed primarily at social stability and a steady supply of basic goods,
      rather than maximisation of profit. <strong>Provisionism</strong> required that food and essential commodities be
      available and affordable in cities. To achieve this, authorities regulated trade routes, storage, and
      distribution and sometimes banned exports in times of scarcity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Traditionalism</strong> favoured continuity: sudden changes in production or consumption were seen as
      disruptive. <strong>Fiscalism</strong> meant that the state sought to ensure reliable revenue flows to finance the
      army and administration. Instruments such as the <strong>narh</strong> (fixed prices), <strong>gedik</strong> (shop/workshop
      licenses) and temporary tax farming were used to manage economic life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In urban centres, crafts and trades were organised into <strong>guilds (lonca)</strong>. Each guild trained
      apprentices, supervised quality, and enforced ethical norms. Religious rituals and charitable activities
      were woven into guild life, reflecting the integration of economic and spiritual concerns.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Social Institutions and Daily Life</h3>
    <p>
      Ottoman cities were dotted with public institutions that shaped everyday life. <strong>Imarets</strong> distributed
      free food to the poor, travellers and students; <strong>hans</strong> and caravanserais offered lodging and security
      for merchants and animals; <strong>hamams</strong> (public baths) provided hygiene and social interaction. <strong>Külliyes</strong>,
      large complexes built around a central mosque, included madrasas, libraries, hospitals, kitchens and
      fountains, symbolising the Ottoman ideal of combining worship, learning, charity and public service in one
      physical space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Religious scholars (<strong>ulema</strong>) formed a respected social group responsible for interpreting Islamic
      law and teaching in madrasas. Sufi orders created networks of lodges across the empire; they attracted
      people from diverse backgrounds and spread mystical teachings, music and poetry.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Architecture, Calligraphy and the Arts</h3>
    <p>
      Ottoman architecture synthesised elements from earlier Islamic, Byzantine and local traditions. In the
      classical age, <strong>Mimar Sinan</strong> perfected the use of the central dome flanked by semi-domes and
      buttresses. His buildings, from the Şehzade Mosque to Süleymaniye and Selimiye, show precise proportional
      systems, controlled light and acoustics, and a balance between monumental scale and human intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interior spaces were decorated with calligraphy, tiles and carved stone. <strong>Calligraphy</strong> (hat) turned
      Qur’anic verses and pious phrases into visual art; styles such as thuluth, naskh, ta’liq and later
      <em>rik‘a</em> evolved under master calligraphers. <strong>Iznik tiles</strong>, with their cobalt blue, turquoise and
      later red colours, covered walls of mosques and palaces with floral and geometric designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Miniature painting</strong> illustrated manuscripts, depicting battles, processions, city views and court
      ceremonies. Rather than realistic perspective, emphasis was placed on narrative clarity and symbolic
      representation. Music, particularly in the form of classical Ottoman art music and Sufi devotional music,
      formed another important dimension of cultural life.

  <!-- TOPIC 4 – VERY DETAILED VERSION -->
  <div id="t4" class="topic">
    <h2>4. Rise, Stagnation and Decline of the Ottoman Empire</h2>
    <p class="tagline">
      From the classical age of expansion to internal crises, European military–economic transformation, and the first major territorial losses: how a world empire tried to adapt to a changing world.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Periodisation: Classical Age, Stagnation and Decline?</h3>
    <p>
      Historians often divide Ottoman history between the mid-15th and late 18th centuries into three broad phases:
      the <strong>Rise / Classical Age</strong>, the so-called <strong>Stagnation</strong>, and the <strong>Decline</strong>. These labels are convenient
      but also somewhat misleading. “Stagnation” does not mean the complete absence of change; “decline” does not
      mean continuous collapse without any recovery. In reality, each phase contained complex mixtures of success
      and failure, adaptation and resistance, innovation and conservatism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Rise</strong> roughly covers the period from the conquest of Constantinople (1453) to the death of
      Süleyman the Magnificent (1566), when the empire expanded, central institutions matured and cultural
      production reached a classical form. The <strong>Stagnation</strong> label is usually applied to the late 16th and
      17th centuries, when the empire faced new structural problems but still remained a major power. The
      <strong>Decline</strong> phase, especially from the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) to the late 18th century, saw
      growing military defeats, territorial losses and the need for deeper reforms, while the empire struggled to
      respond to rapidly changing European conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Rise of the Empire: From Conquest to Classical Structure (1451–1566)</h3>
    <p>
      The rise of the Ottoman Empire in this period is associated with strong sultans, efficient centralisation and
      a flexible administrative system capable of incorporating new territories and populations. The conquest of
      strategic cities, the control of trade routes and the development of a disciplined army all contributed to
      this process.
    </p>

    <h4>2.1. Mehmed II (Fatih Sultan Mehmed) and the Conquest of Constantinople</h4>
    <p>
      Mehmed II ascended the throne with a clear strategic vision: to capture Constantinople, the long-standing
      Byzantine capital and a symbolic centre of Christian power. In 1453, after careful preparation, artillery
      innovations and a combination of naval and land operations, he conquered the city. This event:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ended the Byzantine Empire and removed a political rival in the region.</li>
      <li>Gave the Ottomans control over the Bosporus and key trade routes between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.</li>
      <li>Allowed the sultan to claim universal imperial titles, combining Islamic legitimacy with the legacy of Rome.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After the conquest, Mehmed II worked to repopulate and rebuild the city, now called Istanbul. He invited
      Muslims, Greeks, Armenians, Jews and other groups to settle there, granting privileges and founding
      religious, commercial and educational institutions. He also codified laws (<em>kanunnames</em>) that defined
      relations between state, subjects and timar-holders, laying the foundations of the classical administrative
      order.
    </p>

    <h4>2.2. Bayezid II and Consolidation</h4>
    <p>
      Bayezid II’s reign focused more on <strong>consolidation</strong> than on large-scale conquest. He worked to stabilise
      finances, strengthen the navy in the eastern Mediterranean and integrate newly acquired territories. Internal
      challenges such as dynastic rivalries and religiously motivated revolts (e.g. Şahkulu rebellion) showed that
      the empire, while powerful, still faced tensions between central authority and diverse provincial groups.
    </p>

    <h4>2.3. Selim I (Yavuz) and the Turn to the East</h4>
    <p>
      Selim I shifted the main axis of expansion toward the <strong>Middle East</strong>. His victories over the Safavids at
      Çaldıran (1514) and over the Mamluks at Mercidabık and Ridaniye (1516–1517) brought eastern Anatolia, Syria,
      Palestine, Egypt and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina under Ottoman control. As a result:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Ottomans became the pre-eminent Sunni power in the Islamic world.</li>
      <li>They controlled the pilgrimage routes and key grain routes from Egypt to Istanbul.</li>
      <li>Cairo and Damascus became important provincial capitals, linking the empire more closely to Arab lands.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The acquisition of these territories also meant dealing with new administrative, fiscal and religious
      complexities, as the empire now governed large urban centres with rich scholarly traditions and long-standing
      local elites.
    </p>

    <h4>2.4. Süleyman the Magnificent: Classical Zenith</h4>
    <p>
      Under <strong>Süleyman I</strong>, often called “the Magnificent” in Europe and “Kanuni” (Lawgiver) in Ottoman memory,
      the empire reached its greatest territorial extent and institutional sophistication. His reign combined
      military expansion with legal codification and architectural patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Europe, he advanced into Hungary (Battle of Mohács, 1526), besieged Vienna (1529) and confronted the
      Habsburgs in Central Europe and the Mediterranean. In the east, he continued the struggle with the Safavids
      and secured important cities such as Baghdad. The navy, under admirals like Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha,
      became a dominant force in the Mediterranean, challenging Spanish and Venetian fleets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Süleyman’s legal work is equally significant. He ordered comprehensive <strong>kanunnames</strong> that harmonised earlier
      regulations and sultanic decrees with Islamic principles. These codes regulated taxation, land tenure,
      criminal offences and administrative hierarchies. They did not replace Islamic law but supplemented it,
      creating a predictable legal framework that enhanced state authority and helped integrate diverse regions.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Stagnation: Structural Strains and Changing Balance of Power (Late 16th–17th Centuries)</h3>
    <p>
      By the late 16th century, the empire faced new challenges both inside and outside its borders. The label
      “stagnation” describes a period in which existing institutions came under stress, while the external
      environment changed faster than the empire’s ability to adapt. Nevertheless, the Ottomans remained a
      formidable power and continued to win wars and manage complex administrations.
    </p>

    <h4>3.1. Economic and Demographic Pressures</h4>
    <p>
      Several interconnected economic factors undermined the stability of the classical system:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Price Revolution:</strong> The influx of silver from the Americas into Europe caused widespread inflation.
        As silver flowed through Mediterranean and Balkan markets, Ottoman prices rose, but many soldiers and
        officials were paid fixed nominal salaries. Their purchasing power declined, fuelling unrest.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Demographic Growth:</strong> Population increase in Anatolia and the Balkans put pressure on land and rural
        communities, leading to land disputes and migration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Disruption of Trade Routes:</strong> The rise of Atlantic trade reduced the relative importance of older
        Mediterranean and Silk Road routes, affecting customs revenues and commercial patterns.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3.2. Crisis of the Tımar System and Celali Rebellions</h4>
    <p>
      The <strong>tımar system</strong>, which had linked provincial cavalry service to land revenues, began to deteriorate.
      Wars requiring cash payments, increasing corruption and the selling or illegal transfer of timars weakened
      the link between landholding and military duty. Many peasants abandoned their lands due to war, tax
      pressure or local abuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this context, large-scale rural uprisings known as the <strong>Celali rebellions</strong> erupted, particularly in
      Anatolia. Rebel leaders, sometimes former soldiers or local notables, mobilised discontented peasants,
      deserters and bandits. These movements disrupted agriculture, trade and security, forcing the state to
      launch numerous campaigns to restore order. The Celali crises revealed that the centre could no longer
      easily impose its will on the provinces using traditional instruments alone.
    </p>

    <h4>3.3. Janissaries, Palace Politics and Succession</h4>
    <p>
      The <strong>janissary corps</strong>, originally an elite infantry force recruited through the devşirme system and
      trained in strict discipline, gradually changed in character. Over time, recruitment rules loosened,
      membership became hereditary or open to outsiders and many janissaries engaged in urban trades and
      crafts. They gained political influence, sometimes intervening directly in palace politics to depose sultans
      or grand viziers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, succession practices evolved. Earlier sultans had often participated in provincial
      governorships and military campaigns before ascending the throne, gaining experience. Later princes
      frequently spent their youth in the palace, in semi-isolation, which sometimes limited their training in
      political and military leadership. Intrigues within the harem and between factions of the court further
      complicated decision-making.
    </p>

    <h4>3.4. Military Technology and European Rivals</h4>
    <p>
      European states, particularly in Central and Western Europe, reformed their armies, adopting new drill
      systems, firearms tactics and fortification designs. They also developed more effective fiscal institutions
      to support standing armies. The Ottomans continued to use artillery and firearms, but reforms were uneven
      and sometimes blocked by conservative groups worried about losing privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite these difficulties, the empire still achieved notable successes in the 17th century, such as
      Köprülü-era campaigns and temporary gains in Hungary. However, defeats in prolonged wars – like the long
      struggle against the Habsburgs and the ultimate failure at the Second Siege of Vienna in 1683 – signalled
      that the balance of power was shifting against the Ottomans.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Decline and First Major Territorial Losses (Late 17th–18th Centuries)</h3>
    <p>
      The “decline” phase is marked not only by defeats but also by attempts at reform and adaptation. The empire
      confronted the reality that its existing institutions, while still functioning, were no longer sufficient to
      compete with increasingly centralised and industrialising European powers.
    </p>

    <h4>4.1. The Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) – A Turning Point</h4>
    <p>
      After the failed Second Siege of Vienna (1683), a broad European coalition formed against the Ottomans,
      including Austria, Poland, Venice and later Russia. Years of warfare exhausted the empire. The resulting
      <strong>Treaty of Karlowitz</strong> in 1699 forced the Ottomans to cede large territories in Central Europe, including
      much of Hungary and Transylvania, to the Habsburgs, and lands to Poland and Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karlowitz was significant because it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Marked the first time the empire ceded large, historically contested territories in Europe by formal treaty.</li>
      <li>Symbolised a shift from an expanding frontier empire to a power defending its remaining borders.</li>
      <li>Encouraged European powers to see the Ottomans as a declining empire open to further pressure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4.2. 18th Century: War, Diplomacy and Tulip Era</h4>
    <p>
      The 18th century saw alternating periods of war and relative peace. The Ottomans fought several conflicts
      with Russia and Austria, sometimes regaining territories but often losing strategic fortresses and access to
      important rivers and seas. At the same time, diplomacy became more important; permanent embassies and
      emissaries gained experience in European capitals, observing new military and administrative techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Tulip Era</strong> (Lâle Devri) in the early 18th century, especially under Sultan Ahmed III and Grand
      Vizier Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha, is remembered as a period of relative peace, cultural experimentation
      and selective Westernisation. Printing presses were established (despite resistance), new gardens and
      palaces built in Istanbul, and contact with European art and lifestyle increased. Critics, however, accused
      the elite of extravagance and detachment from the broader population’s problems.
    </p>

    <h4>4.3. Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774) and Russian Expansion</h4>
    <p>
      The advance of the Russian Empire under rulers like Catherine the Great created a new and dangerous rival in
      the north. The Russo–Ottoman war ending in the <strong>Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca</strong> (1774) had far-reaching
      consequences. Russia gained access to the Black Sea, the right to protect Orthodox Christians within the
      Ottoman Empire and the ability to intervene diplomatically on this basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      These concessions undermined Ottoman sovereignty in two ways: territorially, by losing strategic ports and
      fortresses; and politically, by giving Russia a legal pretext to interfere in the empire’s internal affairs.
      Over time, such provisions encouraged other European powers to adopt similar protective roles over different
      communities, fragmenting the empire’s authority.
    </p>

    <h4>4.4. Reform Attempts and the Road to the 19th Century</h4>
    <p>
      Faced with repeated military setbacks, Ottoman statesmen wrote reform memoranda analysing the causes of
      decline. They pointed to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Corruption in tax collection and provincial administration.</li>
      <li>Loss of discipline in the janissary corps and outdated tactics.</li>
      <li>Neglect of science, technology and modern artillery techniques.</li>
      <li>Weak control over remote provinces and the rise of powerful local notables.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some attempts at change were made even before the Tanzimat. New military units were organised along European
      lines; engineering schools and military academies began teaching modern science and mathematics; translations
      of European works slowly entered intellectual circles. However, resistance from vested interests and limited
      financial resources restricted the depth and speed of these reforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the 18th century, it had become clear that the empire could no longer rely on its classical
      institutions alone. The 19th century would bring more radical reorganisation efforts – including the Tanzimat
      and later constitutional experiments – as the Ottomans tried to rebuild their state in the face of nationalism,
      industrialisation and imperialist pressures.

  <div id="t5" class="topic">
    <h2>5. 19th Century Ottoman Era</h2>
    <p class="tagline">
      From early centralization attempts and Tanzimat to the First Constitutional Period, Abdulhamid II’s rule, rising nationalism, great power rivalry and the struggle to keep the empire alive.
    </p>

    <h3>1. The Long 19th Century and the “Eastern Question”</h3>
    <p>
      The 19th century for the Ottoman Empire is often called the “long 19th century” because its key dynamics
      began in the late 18th century and continued into the early 20th century. During this era, the empire faced
      intense pressure from both internal and external forces. Internally, there were problems of administrative
      corruption, outdated military structures, fiscal deficits and local power-holders challenging central
      authority. Externally, industrialising European powers – especially Britain, France, Austria and Russia – 
      sought to expand their economic and political influence, often at the expense of the empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      These rivalries were commonly referred to as the <strong>Eastern Question</strong>: what would happen to the lands and
      peoples of the Ottoman Empire as it seemed to weaken? Each great power wanted to prevent its rivals from
      gaining too much influence over Ottoman territories, while also pursuing its own strategic and economic
      interests. As a result, the empire found itself in a delicate balance, sometimes supported by one power
      against another, but rarely treated as a fully equal partner.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Early Centralisation and the Legacy of Selim III</h3>
    <p>
      Before the famous Tanzimat reforms, significant attempts at change were already underway. Sultan
      <strong>Selim III</strong> (1789–1807) recognised that the traditional military forces, especially the janissaries, were
      no longer adequate against modern European armies. He created a new, Western-style army called
      <strong>Nizam-ı Cedid</strong> (“New Order”), introduced new uniforms, training and artillery, and tried to modernise
      the fiscal system to pay for these reforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the janissaries and conservative groups saw these changes as a threat to their privileges. They
      organised revolts, eventually deposing Selim III. Although his project failed, Selim’s experience showed that
      any serious reform of the army or administration would inevitably challenge entrenched interests. It also
      provided a blueprint for later reformers who understood that the empire must modernise or face further
      decline.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Mahmud II and the Destruction of the Janissaries</h3>
    <p>
      Sultan <strong>Mahmud II</strong> (1808–1839) continued the efforts of Selim III but acted more decisively. He gradually
      prepared the ground for a confrontation with the janissaries by creating alternative military forces and
      building support among provincial notables and segments of the ulema. In 1826, when the janissaries openly
      revolted against his new military organisation, Mahmud II ordered loyal troops and artillery to attack their
      barracks. This event, known as the <strong>Auspicious Incident</strong> (<em>Vaka-i Hayriye</em>), resulted in the destruction
      of the janissary corps.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the janissaries eliminated, Mahmud II could centralise power more effectively. He founded a new,
      regular army based on conscription and European-style training, established modern ministries, reorganised
      the provincial administration and sent students to Europe to study military science and engineering. He
      adopted Western-style clothing for officials, symbolising the shift toward a new bureaucratic culture.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Tanzimat: The Gülhane Edict of 1839</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Tanzimat Edict</strong> (<em>Gülhane Hatt-ı Hümayunu</em>), proclaimed in 1839 at the Gülhane Park in Istanbul,
      is often seen as the official starting point of the Tanzimat Era. Prepared under the influence of statesmen
      like Mustafa Reşid Pasha, the edict promised:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Guarantees for the life, honour and property of all subjects, Muslim and non-Muslim alike.</li>
      <li>Regular and fair taxation instead of arbitrary levies.</li>
      <li>Orderly military conscription and service periods.</li>
      <li>Reform of the judicial system to ensure public trials and legal security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Although many of these promises were not fully realised at once, the Edict represented a major shift: the
      Ottoman state now publicly declared that it would bind itself to certain principles of legality and equality.
      This changed the relationship between ruler and subjects from one based largely on traditional obedience to
      one that increasingly invoked rights and laws.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Tanzimat in Practice: Administration, Law and Society</h3>
    <p>
      In the following decades, a series of reforms attempted to implement the spirit of Tanzimat. New civil and
      commercial codes inspired by French models were introduced, and mixed commercial courts with both Muslim
      and non-Muslim judges were created to handle cases involving foreigners or members of different communities.
      Provincial reform laws sought to standardise administration, reduce corruption and ensure more direct
      control from the centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Education was another key area. New <strong>rüşdiye</strong> secondary schools, teacher training institutions and
      specialised schools of administration, engineering and medicine were established. These schools trained a
      new generation of officials who were fluent in foreign languages, familiar with European political thought
      and experienced in modern bureaucratic practice. Over time, they formed the backbone of a centralising,
      professional state elite.
    </p>

    <h3>6. The Islahat Edict of 1856 and Equality of Non-Muslims</h3>
    <p>
      After the <strong>Crimean War</strong> (1853–1856), in which the Ottoman Empire fought alongside Britain and France
      against Russia, European powers pushed for further reforms, especially concerning the legal position of
      Christians within the empire. The <strong>Islahat Edict</strong> of 1856 reaffirmed many Tanzimat principles but added
      more explicit guarantees:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Formal equality of all subjects regardless of religion.</li>
      <li>Access of non-Muslims to state offices and military service (in theory).</li>
      <li>Reforms in the organisation of Christian communities and their churches.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While these reforms aimed to create a more inclusive imperial citizenship and to reduce European
      interference, they also generated tension. Some Muslim groups felt their privileged status was being
      diminished; some Christian groups saw reforms as insufficient and continued to seek foreign protection or
      national independence. Thus, the Edict both modernised the legal framework and highlighted the complexity
      of managing a multi-religious empire in an age of nationalism.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Foreign Debt, the Ottoman Public Debt Administration and Economic Dependence</h3>
    <p>
      Wars, reforms and infrastructure projects required large sums of money. The Ottoman state, lacking a fully
      modern tax system and industrial base, increasingly turned to foreign loans, especially from British and
      French banks. These loans often carried high interest rates and were used not only for investment but also
      to cover deficits.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the 1870s, the empire’s debt had become unsustainable. In 1875, it declared partial bankruptcy, suspending
      payments on some bonds. In response, European creditors demanded direct control over certain Ottoman
      revenues. The result was the creation of the <strong>Ottoman Public Debt Administration</strong> in 1881, an institution
      run largely by Europeans, which collected specific taxes (such as those on tobacco and salt) to pay foreign
      bondholders. This was a clear sign of economic dependency and limited financial sovereignty.
    </p>

    <h3>8. First Constitutional Period and the Young Ottomans</h3>
    <p>
      A new generation of intellectuals and officials, often called the <strong>Young Ottomans</strong>, became influential in
      the 1860s and 1870s. They criticised both traditional authoritarian rule and purely imitative Westernisation.
      Instead, they argued for a constitutional system that would combine Islamic principles with modern
      representative government. They saw a parliament and a written constitution as tools to control corruption,
      mobilise public opinion and strengthen the empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1876, amid internal unrest and external crises, these ideas gained enough support that Sultan
      <strong>Abdülhamid II</strong>, who had just come to the throne, agreed to promulgate the <strong>Kanun-ı Esasi</strong>, the
      Ottoman constitution. A bicameral parliament was opened, with deputies representing various provinces and
      communities. This marked the beginning of the <strong>First Constitutional Period</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Suspension of Parliament and Abdulhamid II’s Rule</h3>
    <p>
      Shortly after the constitution was proclaimed, the empire became embroiled in a devastating war with Russia
      (1877–1878). Military defeat and political turmoil put great pressure on the new constitutional system.
      Using the war as justification, Abdülhamid II suspended parliament in 1878 and began to rule in a more
      centralised and personal manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reign (often called the <strong>Hamidian era</strong>) is complex. On the one hand, he used censorship, a
      developed intelligence network and tight control over the press and education to limit opposition. On the
      other hand, he supported the expansion of railways, telegraph lines, modern schools and administrative
      reforms. He presented himself as the <strong>Caliph</strong> of all Muslims, using Pan-Islamic symbolism to counter
      European imperialism and to strengthen loyalty among Muslim subjects in distant regions such as India and
      North Africa.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Nationalism and Territorial Losses</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout the 19th century, different national movements within the empire grew stronger. Inspired by
      European nationalist ideas and supported by foreign powers, Greeks, Serbs, Romanians, Bulgarians and others
      demanded autonomy or independence. The <strong>Greek War of Independence</strong>, the establishment of Serbia and
      Romania as principalities and later the Bulgarian uprisings and the creation of an autonomous Bulgarian
      principality gradually removed large parts of the Balkans from Ottoman control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each loss affected the empire not only territorially but also psychologically and demographically. Waves of
      Muslim refugees from lost lands migrated to Anatolia and remaining Ottoman territories, changing the ethnic
      composition and reinforcing an emerging sense of a more Muslim-Turkish core within the empire. This would
      have important consequences for the late Ottoman and early Republican periods.
    </p>

    <h3>11. 19th Century as a Laboratory of Reform</h3>
    <p>
      Overall, the 19th century can be seen as a long and often painful laboratory of reform, where the empire
      experimented with centralisation, legal restructuring, new educational systems, financial modernisation and
      limited constitutionalism. Some initiatives failed quickly; others left lasting institutions and ideas.
      Debates about the role of religion in politics, the definition of citizenship, the balance between central
      authority and local autonomy, and the meaning of modernity continued into the 20th century and shaped the
      intellectual environment from which the Young Turks and later the founding elite of the Republic emerged.

    <h2>6. 20th Century &amp; National Struggle</h2>
    <p class="tagline">
      From the Balkan Wars and the First World War to the armistice, occupations, National Struggle and the foundation of the Republic.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Crisis in the Balkans</h3>
    <p>
      On the eve of the 20th century, the Ottoman Empire still held significant territories in the Balkans but
      faced intense nationalist movements. The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 restored the constitution and
      re-opened parliament, raising hopes for renewal. However, neighbouring states saw the empire’s internal
      weakness as an opportunity. In the First Balkan War (1912), a coalition of Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and
      Montenegro attacked the empire, seizing almost all remaining European lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Second Balkan War (1913) erupted when Bulgaria fought its former allies over the division of spoils.
      The Ottomans managed to recapture Edirne and some territories, but the demographic and psychological
      impact of the wars was profound. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees fled to Anatolia, bringing with
      them memories of loss and a sense of vulnerability that shaped later politics.
    </p>

    <h3>2. First World War and Defeat</h3>
    <p>
      Entering the First World War on the side of the Central Powers, the empire fought on multiple fronts.
      While the Gallipoli campaign is remembered as a defensive success that prevented Allied forces from
      capturing Istanbul, other fronts were less favourable. The Caucasus front saw heavy losses in harsh winter
      conditions; in the Arab provinces, local revolts combined with British support led to the collapse of
      Ottoman control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Armistice of Mondros</strong> in 1918 ended the fighting but imposed severe conditions, including
      demobilisation, control of strategic points and the right of Allied forces to intervene wherever they
      claimed disorder. Soon, foreign troops occupied Istanbul, and parts of Anatolia were divided into zones of
      influence or assigned to Greece, Italy and France according to secret wartime agreements.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Birth of the National Struggle</h3>
    <p>
      In this atmosphere of occupation and disillusionment, local resistance groups formed in different regions.
      Mustafa Kemal, appointed as an inspector to restore order in Anatolia, landed in Samsun on 19 May 1919 and
      gradually turned his mission into a national liberation initiative. The <strong>Havza</strong> and
      <strong>Amasya Circulars</strong> asserted that national independence must be won by the will and action of the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Erzurum and Sivas congresses brought together representatives from eastern and central Anatolia. They
      declared that the country’s territorial integrity and independence were not negotiable and that any mandate
      or protectorate was unacceptable. These meetings united disparate local defence organisations under a
      common political program and leadership.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Grand National Assembly and War of Independence</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Grand National Assembly</strong>, opening in Ankara on 23 April 1920, claimed to represent national
      sovereignty directly and rejected the authority of the occupied Istanbul government. It established
      ministries, raised armies and negotiated with both domestic and foreign actors. The struggle unfolded on
      three fronts: in the east against Armenian forces, in the south against French-led troops and their local
      allies, and in the west against Greek armies backed by some Allied powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After initial difficulties, the national forces achieved significant victories: the First and Second İnönü
      battles demonstrated that the new army could hold its ground; the Sakarya Battle turned the tide by
      stopping the Greek advance towards Ankara; and the Great Offensive and Dumlupınar victory in 1922 broke
      the main Greek forces in western Anatolia. These successes forced the withdrawal of occupation forces and
      compelled the Allies to negotiate.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Lausanne and the End of the Empire</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Mudanya Armistice</strong> ended active hostilities in the western front and cleared the way for a
      peace conference in Lausanne. There, Turkish representatives negotiated with major powers over borders,
      capitulations, war debts and minority rights. The <strong>Lausanne Treaty</strong> of 1923 recognised the
      sovereignty of the new Turkish state within its current borders and abolished capitulations, granting
      economic and legal independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly before Lausanne, the sultanate had been abolished; shortly after, the Republic was proclaimed.
      Thus, the National Struggle did not simply defend old structures but created the conditions for a new
      political order based on national sovereignty, territorial integrity and secular institutions.

  <!-- TOPIC 7 -->
  <div id="t7" class="topic">
    <h2>7. Atatürk’s Reforms &amp; Principles</h2>
    <p class="tagline">
      Comprehensive transformation of state and society after the War of Independence: political, legal, social, educational, economic and cultural reforms, and the six principles of Atatürk.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Political Foundations of the New Republic</h3>
    <p>
      After the success of the National Struggle, leaders in Ankara faced the question of how to institutionalise
      the victory. The abolition of the sultanate in 1922 ended the Ottoman monarchy. On 29 October 1923, the
      assembly proclaimed the <strong>Republic</strong>, electing Mustafa Kemal as its first president. The constitution
      defined the state as a republic based on national sovereignty, with the Grand National Assembly as the
      central organ of legislative power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abolition of the <strong>caliphate</strong> in 1924 further reduced the link between religious authority and
      political power. While the population remained overwhelmingly Muslim, the state was no longer headed by a
      caliph with a universal claim over the Muslim community. Instead, political legitimacy derived from the
      will of the nation expressed through elected representatives.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Legal Reforms and Secularisation</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most far-reaching changes was the replacement of the old legal structure, which had combined
      Islamic law with sultanic decrees and customary practices. The new <strong>Civil Code</strong>, adopted in 1926 and
      inspired mainly by the Swiss model, regulated family law, inheritance, property and obligations on a
      secular, gender-equal basis. Religious courts were abolished, and a unified, secular court system was
      established.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other legal reforms included a new <strong>Penal Code</strong>, <strong>Commercial Code</strong> and procedural laws inspired by
      European examples. These changes not only updated regulations but also signalled a fundamental shift in
      the sources of law: from religious doctrine and imperial will to national legislation based on reason,
      comparative study and parliamentary debate.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Educational, Social and Cultural Reforms</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Law on the Unification of Education</strong> (Tevhid-i Tedrisat) placed all educational institutions
      under the Ministry of National Education, abolishing dual structures between religious schools and
      modern institutions. Primary education was expanded, new schools and teacher training institutes were
      founded, and curricula were redesigned to emphasise science, citizenship and national history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adoption of the <strong>Latin alphabet</strong> in 1928 made reading and writing easier and facilitated mass
      literacy campaigns. Language and history institutions were established to study and promote the Turkish
      language and to reinterpret national history in a secular, research-based framework. Dress reforms
      encouraged Western-style clothing and limited the use of traditional headgear and religious garments in
      public offices.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Women’s Rights and Social Equality</h3>
    <p>
      In the social sphere, Atatürk’s reforms significantly improved the legal and public status of women. The
      Civil Code abolished polygamy, gave women equal rights in divorce and inheritance and recognised civil
      marriage as the only legally valid form. Access to education for girls increased, and women gradually
      entered professions such as teaching, medicine and public service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Politically, women gained the right to vote and be elected at the municipal level in 1930 and at the
      national level in 1934. As a result, Turkish women participated in parliamentary elections earlier than in
      many European countries, symbolising the modernising and egalitarian aspirations of the new regime.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Economic Policy and Statism</h3>
    <p>
      Economically, the republic adopted a pragmatic approach. In the 1920s, the government focused on repairing
      war damage, abolishing capitulations and encouraging private entrepreneurship within a liberal framework.
      In the 1930s, influenced by the global Great Depression and domestic needs, the state moved toward a more
      active role in the economy known as <strong>statism</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      State Economic Enterprises were established in sectors such as textiles, iron and steel, mining and
      chemicals. Five-year development plans guided industrialisation efforts. While private enterprise
      continued to exist, the state took responsibility for creating basic infrastructure and heavy industry,
      aiming at self-sufficiency and balanced regional development.
    </p>

    <h3>6. The Six Principles of Atatürk</h3>
    <p>
      The main orientation of the republic was summarised in six principles, often represented by six arrows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Republicanism:</strong> rejection of monarchy and dynastic rule; sovereignty belongs to the nation.</li>
      <li><strong>Nationalism:</strong> emphasis on a shared civic Turkish identity rather than religious or dynastic
          loyalties; equality of citizens before the law.</li>
      <li><strong>Populism:</strong> opposition to legal privileges of specific classes; ideal of a society without
          corporate estates.</li>
      <li><strong>Statism:</strong> an economic principle advocating state leadership in key sectors to achieve rapid
          development and social justice.</li>
      <li><strong>Secularism:</strong> separation of religious institutions and state institutions; freedom of
          conscience; secular legal and educational systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Reformism (Revolutionism):</strong> commitment to continuous renewal and modernisation rather than
          preserving old forms for their own sake.</li>
    </ul>

  <div id="t8" class="topic">
    <h2>8. Contemporary Turkish &amp; World History</h2>
    <p class="tagline">
      Global transformations from the French and Industrial Revolutions to the world wars, the Cold War and the place of modern Turkey in this changing order.
    </p>

    <h3>1. The French and Industrial Revolutions</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>French Revolution</strong> of 1789 challenged monarchy and aristocratic privilege, spreading ideas of
      citizenship, popular sovereignty and national identity. These ideas inspired liberal and nationalist
      movements across Europe and eventually in regions such as the Balkans and the Middle East. They affected
      the Ottoman Empire indirectly, as various groups within its borders adopted national programs seeking
      autonomy or independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Industrial Revolution</strong>, beginning in Britain and spreading to Western Europe and North America,
      transformed production through mechanisation, coal and steam power, and later electricity and petroleum.
      It led to urbanisation, the rise of a factory-working class, new forms of capital accumulation and global
      trade networks. Industrial powers gained a significant military and economic advantage, which they used to
      expand colonial empires and impose unequal economic relations on non-industrialised regions.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The Two World Wars</h3>
    <p>
      The First World War (1914–1918) and the Second World War (1939–1945) were global conflicts involving
      unprecedented mobilisation of people and resources. They caused massive casualties, the collapse of
      empires, and fundamental shifts in the international order. The first war led to the dissolution of the
      Austro-Hungarian, Russian, German and Ottoman empires. The second war ended with the defeat of Nazi
      Germany and Imperial Japan and revealed the devastating power of nuclear weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Turkey, the legacy of the First World War was particularly significant: defeat and the subsequent
      occupations gave rise to the National Struggle and the founding of a new republic. During the Second World
      War, Turkey remained mostly neutral, mobilising its army but avoiding direct involvement until the final
      phase of the conflict. This cautious policy aimed to protect territorial integrity and avoid the disasters
      experienced in the previous war.
    </p>

    <h3>3. The Cold War and Beyond</h3>
    <p>
      After 1945, the world entered the <strong>Cold War</strong> era, characterised by ideological rivalry between the
      United States and the Soviet Union. Global politics were shaped by alliances, proxy wars, nuclear
      deterrence and competition in science and technology. International organisations such as the United
      Nations and financial institutions such as the World Bank and IMF also played important roles in shaping
      the postwar order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turkey, situated at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and the Middle East, acquired strategic importance.
      It joined the <strong>North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</strong> in 1952, aligning itself with the Western
      security system. At the same time, Turkey pursued domestic reforms, economic development and integration
      with European institutions, while managing complex relations with neighbouring countries in the Balkans,
      the Caucasus and the Middle East.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Globalisation and Contemporary Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, globalisation intensified the flow of goods, capital, people and
      information. Technological advances in transportation, communication and digital networks transformed
      economic and cultural life. At the same time, new challenges emerged: environmental degradation, climate
      change, inequality, financial crises, mass migration and debates over identity and multiculturalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern Turkey navigates these developments as a regional power with a dynamic economy and a young
      population. It faces questions about democratisation, rule of law, secular–religious balance, minority
      rights and foreign policy orientation. Its history – from pre-Islamic steppes to the Ottoman Empire and
      the republican reforms – remains a key resource for understanding present debates and future choices.
